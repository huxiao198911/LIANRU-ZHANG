Title: White Dress Reconstruction

Story:

Friend gave me this lace bikini dress. It is pretty and fits me well, but it is difficult for me to wear it outside in my daily life. So I reconstructed the lower part, and turns it a real dress I can wear in the summer. 


Process:
Step 1: It is hard to find the exact same pink color as upper part, so by the end I chose white color for the lower part;

Step 2: Take the lower inner part apart from the dress；

Step 3: Make the new pattern of the lower dress with right length；

Step 4: Cut the fabric and sew it - Done!
